Licenses
=======

The first step in any open source design approach is to choose a license. This will condition every other step taken afterwards. The license is the social contract a designer is making with everyone else involved in the project. This contract, once set, is explicitely or implicitely signed by the other designers working on improving the project, by the manufacturers of the object and by the final users of it. This social contract is what differenciates open source product design from a more classic approach.

Usually designers think about licensing once they enter in touch with an editor or a manufacturer. This step comes then closer to the end process. This contract usually benefits parties that know each other while it restricts any use beyond those not directly involved in the creation or build process. In this classical approach, the license is mainly a commercial agreement.

Open source design addresses this the other way around and must be placed at the begining of_the process. The license is specifically made for parties that don't know each other. As an open source product designer, I don't know yet who will be involved in my project, who will build it or even maybe what purpose the object will be used for. The license can address commercial terms, but not necessarly.

As with a classic contemporary design approach, licenses are made to protect the designer. But in open source design, these licences are also made to protect the users or any other preson in relation to the design. Nowadays, more and more objects are given to you with restrictions on how you can open it and own it. Take a car for example, or a smartphone. As a user you have very little to say about how those things work, let alone the possibility to repair them when they are broken. And this is not only related to the technical knowledge to do so but also with the legal right to apply any modification.

4 freedoms
----------------

Open source product design is a practice that comes from free and open source software and as such is following the same principles, but applied to objects. There is a general rule that permits to determine if a licence is "open source" or not. Does it respect the [4 freedoms](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html )?

Here are those 4 freedoms applied to objects:

1. The freedom to use objects as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
2. The freedom to study how the object works, om to build it, and change it so it behaves as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the documentation, build processes and sources is a precondition for this.
3. The freedom to redistribute the documentation, build processes, sources and copies of the object so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the documentation, build processes and sources is a precondition for this.

Commercial or Non-Commercial
----------------------------------------------

Many times, the question of the commercial exploitation of a design generates heated debates in the open source design community. We'd like to refer you to the section about economics to understand more about this, but we want to make clear here that any licence that would prevent any commercial use of a design **does not comply** with the open source principles. Why? Because this conflicts or puts limitations on the freedom 2 and 3. And if it limits those, they can not be called freedoms, right?

So stop calling your project "open source design" if you licence it with a commercial restriction. You might then want to have a look at our "Definitions" section to find a better generic name for your project.

Is there an ideal or perfect license for open source objects?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry to say this, but no. Although there is many open source licenses for software and some of those licenses might work for design documents, there is no magic solution that could work in any case. Remember that licenses are generally complex legal documents that try to cover as many cases as possible and that give guidelines on what is permitted or not. As we said, these are social contracts, and as such could be ideal in a particular situation, but be problematic in others. In the case of open source licenses, since these grant more freedoms than they restrict, they generally tend to create less problems than some others. Fortunately also, and as open source product design will become more and more popular, we can expect that licences will improve and adapt to the new conditions brought by our future societies.

Please, refer to the "tools" chapter of this section to have an overview of the licences available and their use cases.

Tools
-------

### [Free Art License](http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/ )
This is the prefered license used by Libre Objet members and Nonpareil. This license has been written by Antoine Moreau and friends and has originated in France. The F.A.L. is very easy to read and simple to understand. It has been written especially for works of art regardless of their type or expression and is respectful of the roman version of the author's right (as opposed to the english copyright)

### [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ ) 
Surprise, surprise! Creative Commons is not a license. **It's a set of licenses**. We often hear: "I publish my creations under Creative Commons." as this would instantly make you a nice person. It does not. Creative Commons proposes licenses that range from total freedom to no freedom at all. Fortunately, due to their popularity, you will find countless texts and studies that explain you the use of one or the other. Their widely use could be beneficial as more and more people understand them and their implications. If you care about restricting some right to your users, Creative Commons offer you those possibilities. Though remember, because of this, some of the Creative Commons licences are not open source. Here is the only ones that you can use for open source designs:  
    - Attribution-Share Alike (CC-by-sa)
    - Attribution (CC-by)
    - Public Domain Dedication (CC0)

### [TAPR License](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html ) 
The Tapr Open Hardware License is a license dedicated to open hardware rnojects, usually electronics components involved in amateur radlio. This license could be applied to any objects and addresses the specificity of open sourcing physical object.

### [CERN](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cernohl/wiki )

### [GPL](https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html )
The Gnu General Public License is the mother of all open source license. It was created by Richard Stallman and has been used and released as early as 1989. This license is certainly the most popular license for free/libre and open source software, but it can also apply to the designs of objects.

### [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/ ) 
The "do What The Fuck you want Public License" is a very short and somewhat funny license that exists as a response to flame wars that often occur between partisans of one license or another.

### [Peer Production License](http://p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License ) 
The Peer Production License by John Magyar, B.A., J.D. and Dmytri Kleiner is a very interesting take at the commercial / non-commercial debate that happens around open source product design. Basically, it can not be considered an open source license as it restricts freedoms on uses and distribution allowing only other commoners, cooperatives and nonprofits to share and re-use the material, but not commercial entities who intent on making profit through the commons without explicit reciprocity. To our knowledge so far, no designs have been released under this type of license.

### [FabL](https://lite6.framapad.org/p/FABL-0.1-incub-COMMENTAIRES )
The Fabrication License is a new license − in the making − especially dedicated to the cases brought by growing popularity of fablabs and open source design. This license is being developped around the same community that developped the Free Art License.
