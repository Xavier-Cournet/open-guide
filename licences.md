Licenses

Statement
---------------

The first step in any open source design approach is to choose a license. This will condition every other step taken afterwards. The license is the social contract a designer is making with everyone else involved in the project. This contract, once set, is explicitely or implicitely signed by the other designers working on improving the project, by the manufacturers of the object and by the final users of it. This social contract is what differenciate open source product design from a more classic approach.

Usually designers think about licensing once they enter in touch with an editor or a manufacturer. This step comes then closer to the end process than the beginning. This contract usually benefits parties that know each other while it restricts any use beyond those not directly involved in the creation or build process. In the classical approach, the license is mainly a commercial agreement. 

Open source design addresses this the other way around. The license is specifically made for parties that don't know each other. As an open source product designer, I don't know yet who will be involved in my project, who will build it or even maybe what purpose the object will be used for. The license can address commercial terms, but not necessarly.

As with a classic contemporary design approach, licenses are made to protect the designer. 

### Commercial or Non-Commercial?

### Is there an ideal or perfect license for objects?
