Economics
========

Often when we speak about *Open Source Product Design*, people are concerned about how to earn money with their creations. And although these concerns are very understandable − every body has to eat −, these questions come from a very narrow point of view on how designers can make money.

Since the industrialisation age and mass manufacture of objects, designers have mainly earned their living by licensing their designs and earning royalties from them. In these cases, exclusivity and popularity of the objects are key elements that influence how a designer will get paid.

But a more traditional way for a designer to earn money is to directly sell his creations. He will then be at the same time designing the object, building it and delivering it to the buyer.

### Ok my design is under free open source license, that means every one can sell my work or making money with? 
Don't be afraid, you can do the same if you want with another opensource project.
If someone make a nice improvement of your design, he should be interested to get some return, money for his work. You can also benefit of this by sell it again on your side.

yes, see motivation section**

### Open designs for economics of the mass collaboration

Some authors have criticized the open source services and objects production linking them with communist movement and arguing that they hinder the development. For example Jaron Lanier, an american computer philosophy writer, tells in his book *You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto* that the open source productions generate a kind expropriation of the intellectual productions that he calls "Digital Maoism". However, in the best-seller book *Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything", the authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, defend that openess is creating a new forms economics development and, even more, they tell that it will be essencial for the economic innovation and development in a near future.

The economic model that is described in this book is based in four point: Openess, Peering, Sharing and Acting Global.

*"Openness, which includes not only open standards and content but  also financial transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas  and resources
Peering, which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum. Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux  as the "quintessential example of peering."
Sharing, which is a less proprietary approach to (among other  things) products, intellectual property, bandwidth, scientific knowledge
Acting globally, which involves embracing globalization and ignoring  "physical and geographical boundaries" at both the corporate and  individual level."*-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics)

Opportunities to explore
----------------------------------
### Education
Through the organisation of workshops, participation in lectures and any other form of knowledge transmission, a designer could get financial support for developping and grow his/her work.

Education of the buyer.
Education of the editor.

### Services
This is a model that comes from the experiences of open source software economies. Developper of open source software don't earn money by selling thcisee software but by selling additional services related to the software. For example, [Automattic](https://automattic.com/ ), the company behind the Wordpress blogging plateform is offering paid hosting for people who don't want to set up and host Wordpress themselves. They also provide services like statistics, anti-spam, backups, etc.

### A user-designer relationship
Just like in other movements, as for example with the delivery of farm products directly from the local farmers to the consumer, open source product designers can leverage on this direct relationship with the buyers.

The relation here can then be based on longer mutual support, more precise understanding of needs and an improved quality of life by respecting the ll your physical design on design market place plateform : 
   - adding webshop kit on your website : magento, ecommerce wordpress plugins...
   - sell printing plans or poster in shops (library, design shop, maker space...)
   - explain that open source is not free. You have the right to sell your drawing/documentation
   or asking people for "donation".

### Crowdfunding

### Open sourcing as a way to get known

### Who's building your open source furniture?
(We must talk about building things. What is the value of an object beeing built by a creator or by some other person > refer to motivation section about copy depends on emotional value)
