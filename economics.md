Statement
---------------

Often when we speak about *Open Source Product Design*, people are concerned about how to earn money with their creations? And although these concerns are very understandable − every body has to eat −, these questions come from a very narrow point of view on how designers can make money.

Since the industrialisation age and mass manufacture of objects, designers have mainly earned their living by licensing their designs and earning royalties over it. In these cases, exclusivity and popularity of the objects are key elements that influence how a designer will get paid.

But a more traditional way for a designer to earn money is to directly sell his creations. He will then be at the same time designing the object, building it and delivering it to the buyer.

But pattern are ver expensives and the copy is always donne anyway...* **maybe in the intro?**

Open designs for economics of the mass collaboration

Some authors has criticise the Open Sourcese services and objects production linking them with comunist movements and arguing that they hinder the development. For example Jaron Lanier, an american computer philosophy writer, tells on his book *You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto* that the open source productions generate a kind expropiation of the intellectual productions that he calls "Digital Maoism". However, in the best-seller book *Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything" the authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, defend that openess is creating a new forms economics development and, even more, they tell that it will be essencial for the economic innovation and development in a near future.

The economic model that is described in this book is based in four point: Openess, Peering, Sharing and Acting Global.

*"Openness, which includes not only open standards and content but  also financial transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas  and resources
Peering, which replaces hierarchical models with a more  collaborative forum. Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux  as the "quintessential example of peering."
Sharing, which is a less proprietary approach to (among other  things) products, intellectual property, bandwidth, scientific knowledge
Acting globally, which involves embracing globalization and ignoring  "physical and geographical boundaries" at both the corporate and  individual level."*-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics)

some possible answers :
- education/teaching/workshop
- services, like in the opensource softwares > Opendesk
- created a viable economic system of business  like Nonpraeil
sell the object at the different step of construction plan / without finish / classic lassic / custum

(We must talk about building things. What is the value of an ojbect beeing built by a creator or by some other person)
