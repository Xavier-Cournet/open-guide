Economies
========

Often when we speak about _Open Source Product Design_, people are concerned about how to earn money with their creations. And although these concerns are very understandable, everybody has to fill their physiological needs and feel safe, these questions come from a very narrow point of view on how designers can be paid.

Since the industrialisation age and mass manufacture of objects, designers have mainly earned their living by licensing their designs and earning royalties. In these cases, exclusivity and popularity of the objects are key elements that influence how a designer makes money.

Patenting a design is a costly adventure and most of the time will only be profitable if you also have the money to enforce it. Having a patent does not make you instantly rich. And if you think someone is infringing your rights, you will have to go to court to solve that problem and make a case for compensation. As you know, going to court requires also money.

### So if I open source my designs, then everyone can make money with it?

Yes. And the other way around is also true, you can make money with other people's open source projects. The shift here is important. If you open source your work, someone else might be interested in it, apply transformation to it, improve it, and this then comes back to you. 

Another thing to consider is, since it's so easy to share digital files and since people, with reason, consider that immaterial objects should be free to copy and distribute, there is still a true cost in making material objects. Not only a material cost, but also a knowledge cost in aquiring the skills to manipulate the tools that will help produce the physical objects and an energy cost in moving around the physical object to their end location. Overall, people are still willing to pay for those costs.

### Benefits

Benefits can not always be measured in money. Participating in community adventures, sharing your knowledge, being open to others and lowering your ego can be profitable for you and your professional project but hardly translated into numbers.

And one could hope, that what open source practices have done for software, with methodologies such as agile problem solving, iterative prototyping and distributed development, similar approaches could change the face of product design and provide benefits yet to discover.

Opportunities to explore
----------------------------------
### Education
Through the organisation of workshops, participation in lectures and any other form of knowledge transmission, a designer can get financial support for developping and grow his/her work.

Education of the buyers and partners is something that should not be forgotten. Although it might be clear for you the benefits of open sourcing your work, this is maybe not the case of your clients or editor. If they understand the concepts and social aspects of open source product desgin, they might be even more happy to invest in your projects or at least understand what they are participating in.

### Services
This is a model that comes from the experiences of open source software economies. Developper of open source software don't earn money by selling the software but by selling additional services related to the software. For example, [Automattic](https://automattic.com/ ), the company behind the Wordpress blogging plateform is offering paid hosting for people who don't want to set up and host Wordpress themselves. They also provide services like statistics, anti-spam, backups, etc.

Designers as well could explore these practices by for example offering customizations of an open source model.

### A user-designer relationship
Just like in other movements, as for example with the delivery of farm products directly from the local farmers to the consumer, open source product designers can leverage on this direct relationship with the buyers.

The relation here can then be based on longer mutual support, more precise understanding of needs and an improved quality of life by respecting the different partners involved. Cutting the middleman could also be profitable for both.

### Free is not gratis
Free/libre licensing does not mean that you can't sell the product. You can sell your plans and pdf, set up a webshop for it and encourage people to donate money so that you keep on improving what you are proposing.

### Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding and open source goes well together, and it might even be the only way this is actually beneficial for all the parties involved. People are always willing to invest in something they find useful and especially if they know that they will get something in exchange and that it will benefit a larger community than just their own.

### Open source as a way to get known
People like to share. If you give them something they have the right to share, they will happily do so. As such, open sourcing some of your work could be a way to get some attention. Your objects might travel further than if you just keep it for yourself and the generosity of open sourcing could shine back on the rest of your projects.

### Who's building your open source furniture?
Something we havent seen explored in open source product design but that could have some impact after a couple of years is the importance of the builder in the open source product design process. If the design files and documentation are freely available to download, then what differenciates an object from another is who has built it. 

Collectors will always be willing to pay extra for a piece that has been built by the original creator than by someone else. The stories around the objects are what give value to it. The agency of an object does not lie only in its function and the art and vintage design market is here to prove it.

Tools

### X-Modules: furniture for Ixelles Library
With  _X-Modules_, Maria Solé Bravo and Julien Deswaef have developped a multi-purpose design to furnish the courtyard at the entrance of the Ixelles public library, in Brussels. As required by the library, the furniture is made from upcycled material: re-used pallets and was built by the neighbors and school children during a series of workshops. The open source nature of the it fitted perfectly with the mission of the library and was one of the key factors that got this project selected after the competition.

### « Sur et Autour du trait »
With their serie _« Sur et Autour du trait »_, Nonpareil sells their open source product designs at different steps of construction. For different prices you can purchase a piece from just the pdf download, a rough build to a classic finish or even order a customization of the object itself.

### [LibreObjet](http://libreobjet.org ) 
Libre Objet is a collective of designers that sustains itself by giving talks and workshops about the practice of open source product design. Members of the collective share some of their designs using open source licenses.

The sharing of information can be beneficial for everybody. Some authors have criticized the open source services and objects production linking them with communist  movement and arguing that they hinder the development. For example  Jaron Lanier, an american computer philosophy writer, tells in his book *You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto* that the open source productions generate a kind expropriation  of the intellectual productions that he calls "Digital Maoism".  However, in the best-seller book *Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration  Changes Everything",  the authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, defend that openess  is creating a new forms economics development and, even more, they tell  that it will be an essencial part of the economic innovation and development in the near future.

The economic models described in this book is based in four point: Openess, Peering, Sharing and Acting Global.

*"Openness,  which includes not only open standards and content but  also financial  transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas  and resources
Peering,  which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum.  Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux  as the  "quintessential example of peering."
Sharing,  which is a less proprietary approach to (among other  things) products,  intellectual property, bandwidth, scientific knowledge
Acting  globally, which involves embracing globalization and ignoring   "physical and geographical boundaries" at both the corporate and   individual level."*-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics)

"Recuperation by collector/Art market" (I dont't if it's the right thing for that)
Original   social design initiatives in the past like furnitures of Gerrit   Rietveld, Enzo Mari, Jean Prouvé, some product of Bauhaus, become now   masterpiece because of the "rarity" of these objects. A Jean Prouvé's   school desk is about 3000€ on the art market
