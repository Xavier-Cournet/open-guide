Economies
========

Often when we speak about *Open Source Product Design*, people are concerned about how to earn money with their creations. And although these concerns are very understandable, everybody has to fill their physiological needs and feel safe, these questions come from a very narrow point of view on how designers can be paid.

Since the industrialisation age and mass manufacture of objects, designers have mainly earned their living by licensing their designs and earning royalties. In these cases, exclusivity and popularity of the objects are key elements that influence how a designer makes money.

Patenting a design is a costly adventure and most of the time will only be profitable if you also have the money to enforce it. Having a patent does not make you instantly rich. And if you think someone is infringing your rights, you will have to go to court to solve that problem and make a case for compensation. As you know, going to court requires also money.

### So if I open source my designs, then everyone can make money with it?

Yes. And the other way around is also true, you can make money with other people's open source projects. The shift here is important. If you open source your work, someone else might be interested in it, apply transformation to it, improve it, and this then comes back to you. 

Another thing to consider is, since it's so easy to share digital files and since people, with reason, consider that immaterial objects should be free to copy and distribute, there is still a true cost in making material objects. Not only a material cost, but also a knowledge cost in aquiring the skills to manipulate the tools that will help produce the physical objects and an energy cost in moving around the physical object to their end location. Overall, people are still willing to pay for those costs.

### Benefits

Benefits can not always be measured in money. Participating in community adventures, sharing your knowledge, being open to others and lowering your ego can be profitable for you and your professional project but hardly translated into numbers.

And one could hope, that what open source practices have done for software, with methodologies such as agile problem solving, iterative prototyping and distributed development, similar approaches could change the face of product design and provide benefits yet to discover.

Opportunities to explore
----------------------------------
### Education
Through the organisation of workshops, participation in lectures and any other form of knowledge transmission, a designer could get financial support for developping and grow his/her work.

Education of the buyer.
Education of the editor.

### Services
This is a model that comes from the experiences of open source software economies. Developper of open source software don't earn money by selling thcisee software but by selling additional services related to the software. For example, [Automattic](https://automattic.com/ ), the company behind the Wordpress blogging plateform is offering paid hosting for people who don't want to set up and host Wordpress themselves. They also provide services like statistics, anti-spam, backups, etc.

### A user-designer relationship
Just like in other movements, as for example with the delivery of farm products directly from the local farmers to the consumer, open source product designers can leverage on this direct relationship with the buyers.

The relation here can then be based on longer mutual support, more precise understanding of needs and an improved quality of life by respecting the ll your physical design on design market place plateform : 
   - adding webshop kit on your website : magento, ecommerce wordpress plugins...
   - sell printing plans or poster in shops (library, design shop, maker space...)
   - explain that open source is not free. You have the right to sell your drawing/documentation
   or asking people for "donation".

### Crowdfunding

### Open sourcing as a way to get known

### Who's building your open source furniture?
(We must talk about building things. What is the value of an object beeing built by a creator or by some other person > refer to motivation section about copy depends on emotional value)

"Recuperation by collector/Art market" (I dont't if it's the right thing for that)
Original  social design initiatives in the past like furnitures of Gerrit  Rietveld, Enzo Mari, Jean Prouvé, some product of Bauhaus, become now  masterpiece because of the "rarity" of these objects. A Jean Prouvé's  school desk is about 3000€ on the art market

Tools
-------
 Goteo
 *"At first glance, Goteo is a platform for civic crowdfunding and  collaboration on citizen initiatives and social, cultural, technological  and educational projects. Goteo has replicas and alliances in several  countries, thanks to its open source code as well as the awards and  international recognition it has gathered since 2011. It is a tool for  generating resources ‘drop by drop’ for a community of communities  consisting of over 65,000 people, with a funding success rate over 70%. 
But in reality, Goteo is so much more. There is a non-profit  foundation (with consequent tax advantages for donors) behind the  platform, and a multidisciplinary team developing tools and services for  co-creation and collective funding. Our commons mission is tightly  linked to principles of transparency, progress and societal improvement." [Goteo.org](https://en.goteo.org/about)

The sharing of information can be beneficial for everybody. Some authors have criticized the open source services and objects production linking them with communist  movement and arguing that they hinder the development. For example  Jaron Lanier, an american computer philosophy writer, tells in his book *You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto* that the open source productions generate a kind expropriation  of the intellectual productions that he calls "Digital Maoism".  However, in the best-seller book *Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration  Changes Everything",  the authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, defend that openess  is creating a new forms economics development and, even more, they tell  that it will be an essencial part of the economic innovation and development in the near future.

The economic models described in this book is based in four point: Openess, Peering, Sharing and Acting Global.

*"Openness,  which includes not only open standards and content but  also financial  transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas  and resources
Peering,  which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum.  Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux  as the  "quintessential example of peering."
Sharing,  which is a less proprietary approach to (among other  things) products,  intellectual property, bandwidth, scientific knowledge
Acting  globally, which involves embracing globalization and ignoring   "physical and geographical boundaries" at both the corporate and   individual level."*-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics)
