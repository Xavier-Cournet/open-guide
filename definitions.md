Definitions
========

Statement
---------------

How could we talk about something if we don't agree on the definitions behind the words we are using. We saw the urge to define a certain number of terms here so that, at least in the scope of this publication, we agree on what they represent. 

As product designers coming from the free/libre and open source software movement, we also are very attached to some words that have been defined in other fields, such as the term "open source".

This book is trying to define "Open Source Product Design" and so we are not going to define this term here âˆ’ you willl have to read the whole book to understand what we mean by this. But you may have already encountered similar terms as "Open design", "Open making", "Open source design" and so on. These overlap each other and sometimes set themselves apart. We're quickly going to talk about them here so we can get them out of the way.


Tools
-------
- [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia ) is a collaborative user-edited encyclopedia. It is fantastic tool for an ever evloving consensus on definitions.
