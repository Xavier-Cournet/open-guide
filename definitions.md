Introduction
=========

[Need to have here a better introduction to the book]

How could we talk about something if we don't agree on the definitions behind the words we are using. We saw the urge to define a certain number of terms here so that, at least in the scope of this publication, we agree on what they represent. 

As product designers coming from the free/libre and open source software movement, we also are very attached to some words that have been defined in other fields, such as the term "open source".

This book is trying to define "Open Source Product Design" and so we are not going to define this term here âˆ’ you willl have to read the whole book to understand what we mean by this. But you may have already encountered similar terms as "Open design", "Open making", "Open source design" and so on. These overlap each other and sometimes set themselves apart. We're quickly going to talk about them here so we can get them out of the way.


#### Product design
>  As a verb is the process of creating a new product to be  sold by a  business to its customers. A very broad concept, it is  essentially the  efficient and effective  generation and development of  ideas through a  process that leads to new  products.
[Source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design )

#### Open making
Open making is a practice mainly defined by the community  around the website and project called OpenDesk. 
>  [They seek] to define  an emerging movement at the intersection of  technology, design  and  manufacturing. [Open design] is an evolving set  of principles and best   practices on design and production for a  collaborative economy.

#### Open design
>  Open design is the development of physical products, machines and  systems through  use of publicly shared design information. Open design   involves the  making of both free and open-source software (FOSS) as  well as  open-source hardware.  The process is generally facilitated by  the  Internet and often  performed without monetary compensation. The  goals  and philosophy are  identical to that of the open-source  movement, but  are implemented for the development of physical products  rather than  software.[5] Open design is a form of co-creation, where  the final  product is designed by the users, rather than an external  stakeholder  such as a private company.

#### Open source design
Open  source design is a term coined mostly by the  graphic design community.  This thus embraces a practice more related to  the study of graphical  user interfaces for software than its physical  counter part. Maybe this  all due to the fact that "design" is such a  broad term that applies to  any action that involves making decisions or  "planning something". http://opensourcedesign.net/

 - Are you "free/libre" or "open source"?
 - Do you think we should agree on a definition?
