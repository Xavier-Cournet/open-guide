Build
-----

If you wish to build this book yourself, you will need Grunt, Gitbook, Calibre and ImageMagick.

Grunt handles the building of the different files.  
A [special version of Gitbook](https://github.com/xuv/gitbook) is used, mainly to better handle fonts in the pdfs.  
Calibre is required by Gitbook to make pdfs, epub and mobi.  
Imagemagick is used to compress the images for the web version of the book.  

Detailed howto is coming soon. File an issue to remind us to post it.
