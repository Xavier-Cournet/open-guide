Open guide into open objects
======================

We are collectively writing the "Open guide into open objects" (Guia abierta a objetos abiertos) at Medialab Prado, Madrid. And you are welcome to write it with us.

If you want to join, please announce yourself on this page:

Here is a list of pads where all the writing is happening. We have broken the subject into sections. For each section we are making statements, suggesting tools and sharing real "open source product design" examples that represent best the subject developped in the section.

**Notes**: 
 - We write using the markdown syntax.
