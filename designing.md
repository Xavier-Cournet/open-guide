Statement
---------------
 So **designing** can be divide in two parts :
- production conceptual / modelise
- Production physique / real
 
 
 ###Designing Tactics
 
 Open Source licences enables you to implement some designing tactics that are not posibly with copyright licences. On the next pages we will talk about some of this tactics.
 
 ####Not Starting From Scratch
 
 "*If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.*" Isaac Newton
 

 ####Modifing
*To make partial changes to.* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/open_source)

When an object has been licenced by certain type of permisions its allows you to make changes in its design. There are many points of the object can be modified: color,  shape, texture, materials, form, functionality. Is also posible to add or remove elements.

#####Color modification example
#####Shape modification example
#####Texture modification example
#####Material modification example
#####Form modification example
#####Functionality modification example
#####Addition modification example
#####Removing modification example

####Adapting
 *To make suitable; to make to correspond; to fit or suit; to proportion.* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adapt)
 
One of the advantages of the open source object is that you are able tu adapt them to your own necesities (or anyone else necesities). There could be diferent reasons for adapting an object. Sometimes the reasons for adapting a design could be personal (Size, proportion, taste...). Other times the reasons for implement an adaptation are related to the fisical context (Clima, scale, materials abailable), technological context (technical knowledge and context abailable) or social context (language, religion, tradition, icons..)

#####Examples of adaptations


 ####Mixing
 *To combine items from two or more sources normally kept separate.* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mix)
 
Another advantage of the open source objects is that they can be combined. You could take two (or more) open source elements and mix them in order to create a new object. This can be a way fast way of create usefull new object.
 
 #####Examples of mixing *Dildo + drill"
 
 ####Coping
 
*To produce an object identical to a given object.*
 
Some licences allows you to copy objects. This not only allows you to copy an object for its use or for distributing it, its also enables you to use the multiple copies of this object for reaching a bigger achievements. For example you can copy an open source single ball for playing with it, or you can copy it a million of times and make a ballpool.
 
 ####Forking
 The “fork” means an object having a common root with a second one.  Initially twins, these two objects will separate and follow their own developments.
 
 #####Examples of Workshop 2015 *divreved objetcs* by Libreobjet
 
 
 ####Upcycling
 is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless  and/or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.
 
 #####Examples of Palets, welcomemamy Martin?


### conceptual / modelise
It's not because your work is done with propriatary software than you project is not opensource.
But we recommend to be logical in your design process. 

#### Software classic...
- Adobe
- Autodesk...

#### Software Opensource for designing objects DAO/CAO
- Librecad
- Freecad
- opencad
- Blender
- inskape

Skils / Knowledge

- Geometric / mathematical
- Parametric design
- Scanning 2d/3d

### Production physique

#### Tools

- Cnc
- lasercuting
- 3d print
- Basic tool

#### Materials

- Pallets > DIY > Basic tool
- Plywood > Cnc
- plastic, composite... > 3d print
