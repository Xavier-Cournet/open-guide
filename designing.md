 So **designing** can be divide in two parts :
- production conceptual / modelise
- Production physique / real
 
 
###Designing Tactics:Not Starting From Scratch
 
  "*If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.*" Isaac Newton
 
Sometime when you are begin with the design of an object your are going to find yourself face to face to with a empty white sheet of paper. But if you work with object with open source licences you will be enabled to implement some designing tactics that allows you to begin working from the work of others designer, instead start from scratch. At the same time, if you licence your design you will allow another designers to use your design, by this way, your design can stay alive, constantly improving and changing. In the following pages we are going to tell you some of the designing tactics that open source tactics allows you.

####Modifing
*To make partial changes to.* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/open_source)

When an object has been licenced by certain type of permisions its allows you to make changes in its design. There are many points of the object can be modified: color,  shape, texture, materials, form, functionality. Is also posible to add or remove elements.

#####Color modification example
#####Shape modification example
#####Texture modification example
#####Material modification example
#####Form modification example
#####Functionality modification example
#####Addition modification example
#####Removing modification example

####Adapting
 *To make suitable; to make to correspond; to fit or suit; to proportion.* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adapt)
 
One of the advantages of the open source object is that you are able tu adapt them to your own necesities (or anyone else necesities). There could be diferent reasons for adapting an object. Sometimes the reasons for adapting a design could be personal (Size, proportion, taste...). Other times the reasons for implement an adaptation are related to the fisical context (Clima, scale, materials abailable), technological context (technical knowledge and context abailable) or social context (language, religion, tradition, icons..)

#####Examples of adaptations


####Mixing
 *To combine items from two or more sources normally kept separate.* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mix)
 
Another advantage of the open source objects is that they can be combined. You could take two (or more) open source elements and mix them in order to create a new object. This can be a way fast way of create usefull new object.
 
#####Examples of mixing *Dildo + drill"
 
####Coping
 
*To produce an object identical to a given object.*
 
Some licences allows you to copy objects. This not only allows you to copy an object for its use or for distributing it, its also enables you to use the multiple copies of this object for reaching a bigger achievements. For example you can copy an open source single ball for playing with it, or you can copy it a million of times and make a ballpool.
 
####Forking
 The “fork” means an object having a common root with a second one.  Initially twins, these two objects will separate and follow their own developments.
 
#####Examples of Workshop 2015 *divreved objetcs* by Libreobjet
 
 
####Upcycling
 is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless  and/or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

### conceptual / modelise (Drawing/Representation Tools?)

There are multiple tools you can use for drawing or representing your designs, from analogical traditional tools like pencil, pens, watercolours or handmade models to digital tools like vectorial drawing applications or 3D digital enviroments for moddeling. Analogical tools, of course, are useful but in order to share design efectively and fabricate them in a fast and precise way we will use digital tools or software of drawing and representation.

It's not because your work is done with propriatary software than you project is not opensource.
But we recommend to be logical in your design process. (This digital software could be propietary or opensource. If you use propietary software to work in your designs its does not mean that your design is not open source. However, we recommend to be logical in your design processes.) 

In the following pages, we will talk about diferent digital tools that you can use for your designs. Do not forget that this are not all the options you can use, only a few ones.


#### Software classic...(Propietary software?)
- Adobe
- Autodesk...

#### Software Opensource for designing objects DAO/CAO
- Librecad
- Freecad
- opencad
- Blender
- inskape

Skils / Knowledge

- Geometric / mathematical
- Parametric design
- Scanning 2d/3d

### Production physique

#### Digital Tools for fabrication

Since the very first industrial manufacture machine "the spinnig jenny" the human being has been looking for improving the automatic fabrication processes  in order to reach faster and more precise results. Thanks to the digital revolution that started in the middle of the previous century, nowadays we can program machines by computer to fabricate tangible object by defining them digitally. At first, this kind of technology was only accesible to professional industry, but in the last decades it has began a democratization process of this technologies, so they has began accesible for everybody.

Some of this tools has been reduced in size, dirtiness and noissiness, so has became, somehow, lets say, domestic. In other cases, the tools are still being  big, dirty and/or noisy, but there has appear a new kind of spaces in our cities that makes them accesible to the non professional people, like, for example, the fablabs. In the following lines we will explain you the diferent tools of digital fabrication that you can use for fabricating open source designs that has been defined digitally.
