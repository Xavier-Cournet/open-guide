Design (as a) process
================

_It's the journey, not the destination._

Designing requires extensive knowledge in many fields and a lot of skills, both intellectual and manual. Skills like fine tridimensional sense, knowledge in geometry, mathematics, mechanics, anatomy and kinetics, proficiency with 2d or 3d software and lets not forget a feel for the beautiful. But don't be afraid, because everybody can design objects. Remember the times in when we used to buid huts, homemade bows or extraordinary worlds made with toys like Lego. Working with open source design does not make assupmptions about your knowledge but taps on your willing to learn and imporve your abilities.
 
Design Tactics
---------------------

### Open prototyping

Designers are usually expected to provide a polished product. With open source practices, this is not the case. You are encouraged to release your concept files and embryo of documentation as soon as possible. Prototyping should be done in the open, permitting other designers to join you.

### Not starting from scratch
 
> If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.  
−Isaac Newton

Sometimes when you are begin with the design of an object your are going to find yourself face to face to with a empty white sheet of paper. But if you work with object with open source licences you will be able to implement some designing tactics that allows you to begin working from the work of others designers, instead of starting from scratch.

### Copying
 
> To produce an object identical to a given object.

Copying is the best way to learn, to appreciate, flatter and get in the mind of the original author. Copying a design, make it as indentical as possible, by redrawing the files in a different application or building replicas of the original object could teach you a lot of skills and give you a great sense of satisfaction. This is all permitted and even encouraged by open source licensing.

### Adapting / modifying
> To make suitable; to make to correspond; to fit or suit; to proportion
−[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/open_source )

One of the advantages of open source objects is that you are allowed to adapt them to your own needs (or anyone else's needs). There could be diferent reasons for adapting or modifying an object. Sometimes the reasons for adapting a design could be personal (size, proportion, taste...), other times related to the physical context (climate, scale, materials available), technological context (technical knowledge and context available), social context (language, religion, tradition, icons..), etc.

If you want to share those changes, some open source licenses require that you publish them under the same license.

### Forking

The “fork” means an object having a common root with a second one. Initially twins, these two objects will separate and follow their own developments. This terms comes from open source software development and was perceived as a negative action implying the death of one of the branch. But nowadays, forking is encouraged as a way to make adaptations to the original work that than could be merged back together afterwards  to improve the original piece.

An example from the _Diverted objetcs_ workshop given by Libre Objet

### Mixing / merging
> To combine items from two or more sources normally kept separate.  
−[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mix)

Another  advantage of open source objects is that they can be combined. Youcould take two (or more) open source elements and mix them in order to  create a new object. This could be an intereseting approach for hybrid desgins and other creative explorations

### Parametric design

A possible approach for easier adaptations of an object is to use parametric design tools.

> Parametric design is a paradigm in design where the relationship between elements are used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures.  −[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_design )

Typically, this can be understood as defining a set of variables and relationship rules inside your design so that when those variables are modified, the resulting object is changed accordingly.

### Upcycling

Upcycling is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless and/or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

This approach, sometimes more associated with DIY and home crafting, could be more formalized and achieve a greater sustainability if it was also approched with the legal framework of open source licensing.

Design Tools
-------------------

### Physical production
Since the very first industrial manufacture machine "the spinnig jenny" the human being has been looking for improving the automatic fabrication processes in order to reach faster and more precise results. Thanks to the digital revolution that started in the middle of the previous century, nowadays we can program machines by computer to fabricate tangible object by defining them digitally. At first, this kind of technology was only available to professional industry, but in the last decades a democratization process of these technologies has started, making them accessible for everybody.

Some of these tools have been reduced in size, cost, dirtiness and noisiness, so they have become somehow more domestic. In other cases, some tools that are still big, expensive, dirty or noisy have appeared in a new kind of spaces that makes them accessible to the non professional people, sometimes named "fablabs", "makerspaces" or "micro-factories".

Neither do you have to rush into complex or automated manufacturing mechanism to design open source objects. Designing things to be made by hand could also appeal to a wider audience.

#### Materials

There are many types of materials that could be used for creating objects and at the same time there are many criterias to choose them. However, there are some properties you should consider for the open source object you are designing.

To achieve the largest distribution, an open source design should be fabricated anywhere by anyone or at least in the greatest amount of places possible and by the broadest range of people. For those reasons, at the time of choosing materials, you might have to consider materials that can be found easily anywhere.

The economic factor is also important. If you choose an extended material but that is expensive, only a few people will be able to build your design. Bu not only economic questions are important, you also should consider the ecologic. There are a lot of material that you can recycle, or even better, upcycle.

Finally you also have to consider the tools that you need to shape these materials. For example, glass and methacrylate are easy to find but while methacrylate could be easily cut by a common cutter, for cutting glass the tools are not as common and the technics are not as simple.



Tools
---------

For each type of task you need to do you would find diferent tools offered. It is important to find the tools that best suits for your designs, not only technically but also ethically. That is why encourage you to use open source tools for making your open source designs. If you use, for example a proprietary software for doing an open source design, as we have said before, it does not mean that your design is not open source. But if you use an open source tool you will ensure that anyone can work on your design without needing to pay the fees for the proprietary software. In addition, you are going to be ethicaly more coherent, which is as important as the openess of the tools used.

On the following lines we will introduce you some open source applications that you can use for designing.


### Free/libre softwares 

There is plenty of tools for a free/libre DAO CAO

-**Librecad**: LibreCAD is a free Open Source CAD application for Windows, Apple and Linux. Support and documentation is free from our large, dedicated community of users, contributors and developers. 
advantage: close to autocad
disadvantage: 

-**Freecad**: FreeCAD is a parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modelingallows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters. FreeCAD is open-source and highly customizable, scriptable and extensible.
FreeCAD is multiplatfom (Windows, Mac and Linux), and reads and writes many open file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, DAE and many others.
advantage: parametric, graphic aided user interface
disadvantage: hard development, not stable

-**Opencad**: OpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.
advantage:
disadvantage: 

-**Blender**: Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.
Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows and Macintosh computers. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience.
advantage: multi-platform, really stable, light, huge community, updated often, lot of tutorials, documentation
disadvantage: complex, 3d abstract appraoch

-**Inskape**: Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Freehand, or Xara X. What sets Inkscape apart is its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based W3C standard, as the native format.
advantage: multi-platform, easy to use, really stable, light, large community, updated, lot of tutorials, documentation
disadvantage: CMYK output (in progress)

### Digital Tools for fabrication

#### CNC router

 ![Homemade CNC router. *by by Drigotti (CC BY-SA 3.0)*](./images/CNC_Router_ by Drigotti CC BY-SA 3.0.png)

*"A CNC router is a computer controlled cutting machine related to the hand held router used for cutting various hard materials, such as wood, composites, aluminium, steel, plastics, and foams. CNC stands for computer numerical control. CNC routers can perform the tasks of many carpentry shop machines such as the panel saw, the spindle moulder, and the boring machine. They can also cut mortises and tenons.
A CNC router is very similar in concept to a CNC milling machine. Instead of routing by hand, tool paths are controlled via computer numerical control. The CNC router is one of many kinds of tools that have CNC variants.
A CNC router typically produces consistent and high-quality work and  improves factory productivity. Unlike a jig router, the CNC router can  produce a one-off as effectively as repeated identical production.  Automation and precision are the key benefits of cnc router tables."*

*"CNC routers come in many configurations, from small home-style D.I.Y.  "desktop" like k2 cnc, to large industrialCNC routers used in sign  shops, cabinet making, aerospace and boat-making facilities"* 

*"CNC routers are generally available in 3-axis and 5-axis CNC formats.  Many Manufacturers offer A and B Axis for full 5 Axis capabilities and  rotary 4th axis"*

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC_router)

#### Laser cutter

> Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,[1] leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.  
−[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting)

#### 3D printer

 ![Homemade RepRap 3D printer. *by by Drigotti (CC BY-SA 3.0)*](./images/RepRap Home made 3D printer_by Tiia Monto CC BY-SA 3.0.jpg)

> 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to various processes used to synthesize a three-dimensional object. In 3D printing, successive layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. These objects can be of almost any shape or geometry, and are produced from a 3D model or other electronic data source.  
3D printing in the term's original sense  refers to processes that sequentially deposit material onto a powder  bed with inkjet printer heads. More recently, the meaning of the term  has expanded to encompass a wider variety of techniques such as extrusion and sintering-based processes. Technical standards generally use the term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.  
−[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing)

#### Make your own tools
Improving your tools by yourself or making your DIY tools for doing you DIY design is another option. In the traditional woodworking this was a very common practice. Nowadays there are a lot of people that make their own tools or improving their own tools. For example the conversions of milling hand routers into a CNC routers or the fabrication of 3D printers.

![**REEBOeK** by Verly Laurent. Free Art Licence](./images/REEBOeK _Verly Laurent.JPG)

[Bouctje](http://libreobjet.org/objects/bouctje/ ) is a bookshelf designed by Mathieu Gabiot on january 2013 and licenced with a Free Art Licence. [Reeboek](http://libreobjet.org/objects/reeboek/ ) is derived design of Bouctje made by Verly Laurent on september 2013 also licenced with a Free Art Licence. This is a good example about the advantages of the open source objects. Thanks to the open licence of Bouctje, its design could be modified,  its scale and functionality were changed, and a new object with a new propouse born.

### Wikiseat

"*WikiSeat is an open source furniture project. That means  that all of the documentation for how to build a WikiSeat is freely and  openly published online.
At the heart of each WikiSeat is a Catalyst. This is the  structural support, made out of welded angle iron, that helps hold three  legs in place. The seat part goes on top. It is a pretty simple idea,  but there are no instructions for how to assemble these parts. We  encourage people to find materials rather than buying them from a  store. Every WikiSeat is a truly unique creation, a reflection of the  creators environment and ideas.*"

Open questions
----------------------

- Do you think that the open source licenses make designing easier for non-professional people? 
- Do you think that the open source licenses make designing more democratic?
- Do you prefer starting from scratch or from existing design?
