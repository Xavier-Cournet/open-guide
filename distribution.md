Distribution
========

**Distribution** is one of the key feature of open source design. This is the main reason we attach an open license to an object, to encourage its dissemination. Distribution is not only bringing a manufactured object from its production facility to the final user, it is also a feature of the object, a communication process, a dialogue between the designers, the builders and the users. In open source product design, distribution is the second step a creator has to take after choosing a license and will mostly be the continuous step that will prevail through the design's life.

**Distribution** has to be thought from 2 interacting point of views:
 - The physical
 - The dialogue
 
The physical
------------------
How is your object physically distributed?

As mentioned in the "Motivations" section, one of the benefits of open source product design is that the documentation can travel faster using contemporary communication tools than shipping an object in a container. This then potentially seperates even more the places where the objects are imagined from places where objects are built. It' is already the case when design is done in western countries for a western market and the resulting objects are produced in countries through cheap labor. But with open source product design, this relationship can be totally broken as objects could potentially be designed anywhere and fabricated where they are needed. At least, this is where we do see the benefits of it. Of course, this particular relation could be "closed" again if only specific skills and tools that are required to design and produce the objects. 

### Distributing physical open source object

Something that is quite easier to figure with software is if the software itself is open source. This is normally clearly indicated in the software itself. But with objets, this can be tricky. How can I know that the object I'm using is opensource?

> refer to a license or a sign somewhere on the object.
>  marking by engraving, laser, sticker, the license name or an url where  you can find further informations about this objects (license,  sources...)
Why?
because  if it is only on separate sheet/document or packaging, this information  can be lost if the user/buyer decide to give this object to other. New  user can have no idea about the origin and loose the oportunity of what  open source can give it him (adapt, remix, etc...)
This  thing is still an issue about the complexity to add information on a  object (small object, smooth materials...). We are still looking for new  ideas.
 
The dialogue
------------------
How open is your conversation?

The dialogue between a designer and any other person involved in the project will be done through **the documentation**. If you don't document your project, nobody will be able to interact with it in a constructive manner. If we could again make a comparison with software, if you don't distribute the source code in a readable manner, if you only distribute binary files, it can not be open source software. Same thing with objects, the full documentation is a requirement for open source product design.

By documentation, we mean all the all the documents one will need to copy and modify the product easily.

Documentation can take many form. It could be sound, video, schemas, 3D files, 2D files, scanned drawings, etc. We don't see were one type or the other should be excluded as long as it is the most suitable format for documenting the project. But documentation has to always be published under an open source license and be available in an open standard.

Documentation is often overlooked by designers. And many project fall short on being called open source product design because of their lack of or poor docunentation. A rule of thumb when making a project is to consider that documentation will take at least 50% of the time.

Documentation
----------------------

Here are a list of things you should consider when documentating objects. This list is based on requirements we've made for adding objects to the collection of [Libre Objet](http://libreobjet.org ) :
- general view (picture or drawing) of your object
- general size (L x H x D) in mm or cm or inches
- general standard views (front, left/right side, up/down)
- list of all materials used in the composition of your object
- list of tools required to build the object
- date of creation
- name of designer(s) and any other authors
- name of builder
- full license text (FAL, CC, CERN...)
- url(s) of sources (if available)
- description of each part, like technical drawing with size, scale, front
- description for the assembly, the order/way to mount (drawings, pictures, better than text but why not)
- description of potential issues or different way to improve the project after (see Entropie's Doc http://www.asso-entropie.fr/media/filer_public/cd/37/cd37e323-1f8c-450e-8cbc-0fe9a12f95bb/table_et_banc_entropie_juillet2013.pdf)
- ways of using the object

### How deep is your source?
- documentation + license + 3d/2d files 
For example, Entropie don't share digital files, only pdf. Not so easy to remix or fork their design before the step of making...But they do it in this case (http://www.asso-entropie.fr/fr/design-libre/atelier/documents/ )but you don't have documentation...

### Where to publish your design?
On your own website first
existing plateforms :
- libreobjet.org


Tools
-------
 - hosting plateforms
 - Instruction manuals / schemas
 - Open standards
 - file sharing
 - upload / Download
 - wikis
 - Fablabs/Makerspaces
 - Local manufacturer
- distributed versioning
- **Teaching / Education** is a good way to share projects and ideas.

Objects
-----------
 - Gun?

References
----------------
- Libre Objet
- Instructables
- Github / Gitlab

Open questions
----------------------
- How can you make your object integrate in the design  its license and documentation?
- How can you tell the user that the object s/he is using is open source?
- What is an object that distribute itself?
