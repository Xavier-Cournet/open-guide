Distribution
========

Statement
---------------

**Distribution** is one of the key feature of open source design. This is the main reason we attach an open license to an object, to encourage its distribution. Distribution is not only bringing a manufactured object from its production facility to the consumer, it is also a feature of the object, a communication process, a dialogue between the designers, the builders and the users. In open source product design, distribution is the second step a creator has to take after choosing a license.

**Distribution** has to be thought from 2 interacting point of views:
 - The physical 
 - The dialogue 
 
 ### Documentation
 We are thinking that an open source object have to be documented to be really "Open".
 It's not just apply a license one it.
 So it's really important to attach to your design an instruction manual, 2d and 3d files, licences, photos... 
 In other words, all the documents you need to copy and modify the product easily.
 It's a really important part of the design you want to share. When you are looking for open source design, it is in many situations incomplete because it will take time to do it in the best way. Also because of lazyness of the designer who want to share the most quickly as possible or because it is a boring job...

Composition of instruction manual:
- general view (picture or drawing) of your object
- general size (L x H x D) in mm or cm or inch
- general standard views (front, left/right side, up/down if necessary)
- list of all materials used in the composition of your object
- list of tools required to remake the object
- date of creation
- name of designer/ other authors if there are
- name of builder
- the license choice (FAL, CC, CERN...)
- url of sources
- description of each part like technical drawing with size, scale, front
- description for the assembly, the order/way to mount (drawings, pictures, better than text but why not)
- description of potential issues or different way to improve the project after (see Entropie's Doc http://www.asso-entropie.fr/media/filer_public/cd/37/cd37e323-1f8c-450e-8cbc-0fe9a12f95bb/table_et_banc_entropie_juillet2013.pdf)
- terms of use (limit of use/ responsability)

How deep is your sources:
- documentation + license + 3d/2d files 
For example, Entropie don't share digital files, only pdf. Not so easy to remix or fork their design before the step of making...But they do it in this case (http://www.asso-entropie.fr/fr/design-libre/atelier/documents/ )but you don't have documentation...

Where publishing your design?
On your own website first
