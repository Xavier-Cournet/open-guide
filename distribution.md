Distribution
========

Statement
---------------

**Distribution** is one of the key feature of open source design. This is the main reason we attach an open license to an object, to encourage its distribution. Distribution is not only bringing a manufactured object from its production facility to the consumer, it is also a feature of the object, a communication process, a dialogue between the designers, the builders and the users. In open source product design, distribution is the second step a creator has to take after choosing a license.

**Distribution** has to be thought from 2 interacting point of views:
 - The physical 
 - The dialogue 


Tools
-------
 - hosting plateforms
 
 - Instruction manuals / schemas
 - Open standards
 - file sharing
 - upload / Download 2d, 3d
 We are thinking that an open source object have to be docuented to be really "Open".
 It's not just apply a licennce one it.
 So it's really important to design an instruction manual, 2d and 3d files, licences, photos... 
 In other words, all the documents you need to copy and modify the product easily.
