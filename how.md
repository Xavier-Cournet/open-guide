Tools
-------

We used this toolchain of free/libre and open source softwares to bring the book to life:

### Etherpad
Etherpad is a browser based text editor that allows many people to write together in real-time and on the same page. http://etherpad.org/

### Markdown
We used the markdown syntax as it is very easy-to-write and easy-to-read plaintext format that can be converted in HTML while keeping this structured. http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

### Bash
A small bash script was used to download and backup regularly all the texts that were written in all the pads. https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

### Git
Git, todays's most famous version control system, was used to keep tracks of the text changes and to sync those with an online repository held at Github. http://www.git-scm.com/

### Sparkleshare
Sparkleshare behaves a little like the infamous Dropbox, but uses a git repository as a backend. This tool made it easier to sync files and folders between computers, while keeping track of changes and without having anyone to learn how Git works. http://sparkleshare.org/  

### Gitbook-cli
Gitbook-cli is an open source software based on Nodejs that transforms a set of markdown files and folders into different electronic book formats (pdf, epub, mobi, html). https://www.gitbook.com/
