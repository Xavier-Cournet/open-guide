Tools
-------

We used this toolchain of free/libre and open source softwares to bring the book to life.

### Etherpad
Etherpad is a browser based text editor that allows many people to write together in real-time on the same page. http://etherpad.org/

### Markdown
We used the markdown syntax as its very easy-to-write and easy-to-read plaintext format can be converted in HTML while keeping it structured. http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

### Bash
Bash is a shell scripting language available on *nix systems. A small bash script was used to download and regularly backup all the texts that were written in etherpads. https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

### Git
Git, today's most famous version control system, was used to keep track of the text changes and to sync those with an online repository held at Github. http://www.git-scm.com/

### Sparkleshare
Sparkleshare behaves a little like the infamous Dropbox, but uses a git repository as a backend. Created by Hylke Bons, this tool made it easier to sync files and folders between computers, while keeping track of changes and without anyone needing to learn how Git works. http://sparkleshare.org/  

### Gitbook-cli
Gitbook-cli is an open source software based on Nodejs that transforms a set of markdown files and folders into different electronic book formats (pdf, epub, mobi, html). https://www.gitbook.com/

### Podofo
Podofo is a PDF manipulation toolbox created by Pierre Marchand, member of the open source graphic design studio [OSP](http://osp.kitchen) in Brussels. Podofoimpose was used to produce a different imposition of the pdf for home printers.

### Fonts
We use these excellent libre fonts in the book:
 - TGL by Peter Wiegel released under the SIL Open Font License 1.1
 - Open Sans by Steve Matteson released under Apache License  2.0
