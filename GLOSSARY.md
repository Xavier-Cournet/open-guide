### Property
>   In the abstract, property is that which belongs to or with   something,   whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing.  In  the   context of this article, property is one or more components  (rather    than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal, of a  person's  estate;  or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or  jointly a  group  of people or a legal entity like a corporation or  even a  society. (Given  such meaning, the word property is  uncountable,  and as  such, is not  described with an indefinite article  or as plural.)   Depending on the  nature of the property, an owner of  property has the   right to consume,  **alter**, **share**,  **redefine**, rent, mortgage,  pawn, sell,  exchange, transfer, give  away or destroy it, or to exclude  others from  doing these things, as  well as to perhaps abandon it;  whereas regardless  of the nature of the  property, the owner thereof has  the right to  properly use it (as a  durable, mean or factor, or  whatever), or at the  very least  exclusively keep it.
