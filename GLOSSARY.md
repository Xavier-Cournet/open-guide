# Copyright
> Copyright  is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the  creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and  distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive  rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to  copyright law, including fair use.

> Copyright  is a form of intellectual **property**, applicable to certain forms of  **creative work**. Under US copyright law, legal protection attaches  only to fixed  representations in a tangible medium. It is often shared among multiple  authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work,  and who are commonly referred to as rightsholders. These rights  frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works,  distribution, public performance, and "moral rights" such as  attribution.

> Copyrights  are considered **territorial rights**, which means that  they do not  extend beyond the territory of a specific jurisdiction.  While many  aspects of national copyright laws have been standardized  through  international copyright agreements, copyright laws vary by country.

# Copyleft
> Copyleft (a play on the word copyright)  is the practice of offering people the right to freely distribute  copies and modified versions of a work with the stipulation that the  same rights be preserved in derivative works down the line.

> Copyleft  is a form of licensing, and can be used to maintain copyright  conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, to  art.  In general, copyright law is used by an author to prohibit  recipients  from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their  work. In  contrast, under copyleft, an author may give every person who  receives a  copy of the work permission to reproduce, adapt,  or  distribute it, with the accompanying requirement that any resulting   copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement.
Copyleft  licenses for software **require that information necessary for   reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients   of the binaries**. The source code files will usually contain a copy of  the license terms and acknowledge the authors.

# Open  Source 
> In production and development, open source as a development  model promotes universal access via a free license to a product's design  or blueprint, and universal redistribution of  that design or  blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by  anyone.

More on open source licensing in the "Licenses" section of this book.

# Licence 
> The noun license refers to that permission as well as to the document  recording that permission. A license may be granted by a party  ("licensor") to another party ("licensee") as an element of an agreement  between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is "an  authorization (by the licensor) to use the licensed material (by the  licensee)."

# Author  
> An author is broadly defined as "the person who originated or gave  existence to anything" and whose authorship determines  **responsibility** for what was created.

# Property
> In the abstract, property is that which belongs to or with  something,  whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In  the  context of this article, property is one or more components (rather   than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal, of a person's estate;  or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group  of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society. (Given  such meaning, the word property is uncountable,  and as such, is not  described with an indefinite article or as plural.)  Depending on the  nature of the property, an owner of property has the  right to consume,  **alter**, **share**, **redefine**, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell,  exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from  doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless  of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to  properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the  very least exclusively keep it.

# Open making
Open making is a practice mainly defined by the community  around the website and project called OpenDesk. 
> [They seek] to define  an emerging movement at the intersection of technology, design  and  manufacturing. [Open design] is an evolving set of principles and best   practices on design and production for a collaborative economy.

# Open design
> Open design is the development of physical products, machines and  systems through  use of publicly shared design information. Open design  involves the  making of both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as  open-source hardware.  The process is generally facilitated by the  Internet and often  performed without monetary compensation. The goals  and philosophy are  identical to that of the open-source movement, but  are implemented for the development of physical products rather than  software.[5] Open design is a form of co-creation, where the final  product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder  such as a private company.

# Open source design
Open source design is a term coined mostly by the  graphic design community. This thus embraces a practice more related to  the study of graphical user interfaces for software than its physical  counter part. Maybe this all due to the fact that "design" is such a  broad term that applies to any action that involves making decisions or  "planning something". http://opensourcedesign.net/
