Why would you want to get into open source product design? 

The state of design today
------------------------------------

It seems like the only thing that worries designers these days is how to protect their work and their profits in a very conservative way. You've also heard many times someone comes with a supposedly good idea, someone else will promptly say "*− you should patent it!*", as if this was the only way to deal with your creativity.

If profit is the golden ratio of success stories and the prism through which design should be thought today, then this what we end up with:

#### Protection
What we learn in most design schools is all about protecting our work using patents and industrial design related rights (model and drawing deposits, etc.). There is also, of course, the default author's right applied to any "creation de l'esprit" (intellectual creations), as the french call it. Patents and deposits have a costs, are limited in time and limited by territory, unless you have almost infinite ressources.

#### Obsolescence
> Obsolescence is the state of being which occurs when an object, service, or practice is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order. [Wikipedia]
Of which there is the now famous planned obsolescence with the sole intention of increasing sales volume and producing garbage.

#### Copy & anti-copy
> The concept of copying has a particular significance in certain areas of law. In each of the primary areas of intellectual property law, a number of cases have refined the question of what exactly constitutes the kind of copying prohibited by law, especially in areas such as copyright law.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copying )

There is much debate around copying and its usually negative connotations. There is "illegal copies" which could harm you or the author, the dillusional control over copiers and the hypocricy of some education systems who tend to punish copying but ask students to recite what they have learned. Copy is also invariably associated with stealing, thanks to the entertainment industry, although those two are very different concepts.

A chinese copy is only an opportunity to get a low cost famous designer chair, but somehow it's is not the same as an orginal or official copy/edition in terms of emotional value.

### A "mental model" of design

#### A designer is an artist
A designer is a creator, an artist, who gets inspiration from a divine origin. Citation from the masters is authorized, but s/he should always come with something new and original.

#### Design localy, fabricate far away
Famous designers work like big brands, where their products are fabricated on the other side of the planet to limit costs and keep prices low for the end market while keeping a comfortable margin for the producers.

#### Mass production
Design for manufacturing, where standard sizes are the norm and your products have to fit in predefined boxes. How fast can you get your porduct out and in what numbers? 

#### Design for the rich
Quality design is a luxury product. Only the rich can access it.

#### Design and technology
Designer are always excited about the latest technology. Design for the third industrial revolution or with the latest materials from NASA. But what are we designing for?

Design for humans
---------------------------
With open source product design, we're moving the whole design process back to the source: taking care of humans, every human.

We are looking for a generous creative attitude where we know that an artwork is inspired by nature and should respect it.

We allow ourselves to copy as a way to learn, encourage our creativity and iterate design processes.

We learn from traditions and existing designs, and do not try to reinvent the wheel every time.

We don't focus our designs on revenues but see it as a service for society. 

We choose the free/libre way because we can rely on a community for help, co-working and remixes.

We are not afraid of being copied.

We want a close relationship with our users, turn them into active contributors and get objective feedback.

We want to challenge the status quo and break social barriers.

We think of product design as a process, as communication, as information, and it wants to be free.

We know open source licensing is a key in upcycling and a legal framework for cradle to cradle thinking.

We don't have one size fits all so here's our files to make it fit for you.

We are not looking for perfection but know we have a better chance of acheiving if we work together.

If you can't modify it, repair it or improve it, you don't own it and this makes us angry.



opter pour une licence libre permet de garantir le respect et la protection du droit d'auteur, tout en assurant sa visibilité et sa diffusion.

L'utilisation de licences libres change aussi le mode de production, de conception et de fabrication d'un objet. Le travail de designer demande énormément de qualités et de savoir-faire. Un seul objet peut prendre des années à se concevoir et requiert de multiples compétences. Souvent, plusieurs personnes interviennent dans le design d'un seul objet. Le fait de publier sous licence libre ouvre la possibilité de travailler à plusieurs, à distance et de manière ouverte par des jeux de cycles publication-modification successifs.

Le consommateur peut s'approprier un objet, en faire un usage différent ou l'adapter à ses propres besoins. Cet acquis généralement admis pour tout ce qu'on achète n'est plus aussi vrai aujourd'hui.
Souvent l'acheteur « perd sa garantie » s'il manipule l'objet qu'il a acheté ou en fait une utilisation inappropriée. Au pire, il risque même des poursuites judiciaires dans certains cas. Avec les objets libres, nous revendiquons le plein pouvoir de l'acheteur sur ce qu'il a acquis. 

**Why did you chose open design? 
> because is ecodesign?**
Ecodesign is an approach to designing product with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its  whole lifecycle. In a life cycle assessment, the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecodesign
When designer is preocupated by opensource, he is surly an humanist person. So environmental aspect is an important part of his work.
- Procurement: most of the open design project's use local material
- Manufacture: The product is construct on demande localy, you don't have to transport it fom China to Europe for exemple.
When a person chose an openproduct, she is not a lambda customer.
She's more in a collaborative consumption and in a sharing economy than is less 
polluting system than productive consumption.

### Shaker movement
The shaker movement is a religious sect that had guiding principles of simplicity, utility and honesty. Their beliefs were reflected in the well-made furniture of minimalist designs.
The Shakers' dedication to hard work and perfection has resulted in a unique range of architecture, furniture and handicraft styles. They designed their furniture with care, believing that making something well was in itself, "an act of prayer." Before the late 19th century, they rarely fashioned items with elaborate details or extra decoration, but only made things for their intended uses. [...]
Early 19th-century Shaker interiors are characterized by an austerity and simplicity. The simple architecture of their homes, meeting houses, and barns have had a lasting influence on American architecture and design.

### Victor Papanek
He was a designer and educator who became a strong advocate of the socially and ecologically responsible design of products, tools, and community infrastructures. He disapproved of manufactured products that were unsafe, showy, maladapted, or essentially useless. His products, writings, and lectures were collectively considered an example and spur by many designers. Papanek was a philosopher of design and as such he was an untiring, eloquent promoter of design aims and approaches that would be sensitive to social and ecological considerations. He wrote that "design has become the most powerful tool with which man shapes his tools and environments (and, by extension, society and himself).

### Jean Prouvé
Jean grew up surrounded by the ideals and energy of "l'École de Nancy," the art collective to which his father belonged. Its goals were to make art readily accessible, to forge links between art and industry, as well as between art and social consciousness.

The metal furniture of Jean Prouvé was produced copiously in every studio and workshop. His work involved frequent collaboration, most famously with Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret.[16] The style is set apart from the Bauhaus steel furniture of the time by his rejection of the steel tube technique. Prouvé had more faith in the durability and form of sheet metal, "bent, pressed, compressed than welded". His designs speak of a work philosophy that includes knowledge of the materials at hand, a commitment to collaboration between artists and craftsmen, an attention to evolving technical developments, and "the principle of never postponing decisions so as neither to lose the impetus nor indulge in unrealistic forecasts". Prouvé was influential in the development of the idea of nomadic architecture, likening a chair to a house, and designing both with portability in mind.

### Art and design
[Carpenters Workshop Gallery](http://carpentersworkshopgallery.com)
"When we started out, less than a decade ago, there was little  connection between art and design. Since then, things have changed so  much. We are pleased to see that now there are designers who no longer  do industrial design; they are creating a new kind of discipline that is  closer to art", - says Julien Lombrail about the concept of the  gallery.
It's the art market create that kind of design. The price of the pieces are very huge, just an elite can buy it. And the "Designer" now called "artist" became stars.

### Enzo Mari
Enzo Mari is a noted Italian modernist artist and furniture designer.
He is famous for his *Autoprogettazione* manual. 

*The 19 ‘Do-It-Yourself’ furniture designs, which the Italian Designer Enzo Mari published in his book ‘Autoprogettazione’ in 1974, marks a milestone in the comtemporary design history. Positioned in contrast to the formalism at the time, Enzo Mari suggests the democratisation of design and creating a provoking alternative to the capitalist paradigm of mass consumption. Building your own furniture, when required, that’s the idea.* Also that project born in 1974 just after the first oil crisis in 1973. The poverty in Italy and all Europe was huge, Enzo Mari by this project, show that problem and give an social design answer.

### Gerrit Rietveld
Rietveld was a Dutch furniture designer and architect. One of the principal members of the dutch artistic movement called *De Stijl*.Piet Mondrian is the most famous figure from that movememt. Rietveld is famous for his Red and Blue Chair and for the Rietveld Schröder House.

About Crate series:
The original “Krat” (Crate) furniture was produced using untreated red spruce normally reserved for packing cases. It was sold in a kit form, to be assembled at home by the purchaser. The Crate furniture was a response to the economic crisis of the 1930s. It offered useful, inexpensive seating with basic construction and cheap materials. Other items of 'Crate' furniture include a Crate easy chair, Crate table, Crate desk, Crate bookcase and a Crate stool, all from 1934.
