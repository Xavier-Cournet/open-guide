The state of design today
-------------------------------------

It seems like the only thing that worries designers these days is how to protect their work and their profits in a very traditional way. You've also heard many times someone comes with a supposedly good idea, someone else will promptly say "you should patent it", as if this was the only way to deal with your creativity.

### Protection
What we learn in design schools is all about protection of the design using patents and industrial design related rights (model and drawing deposits, etc.). You might have also had courses on the author's rights.
**ISSUE** : time limit, cost, territory limit

### Obsolescence
Obsolescence is the state of being which occurs when an object, service, or practice is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order.
**ISSUE** : limited time of use, unreparability, waste, capitalism

### Copy
The concept of copying has a particular significance in certain areas of law. In each of the primary areas of intellectual property law, a number of cases have refined the question of what exactly constitutes the kind of copying prohibited by law, especially in areas such as copyright law.  
**ISSUE** : illegal copy, impossible to control ( [Grcic chair chinese's copy](http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/replica-magis-chair-one-by-Konstantin_60139375703.html ) )

A chinese copy is only an opportunity to get a low cost famous designer chair, but this is not the same as an orginal or official copy/edition in term of the emotional value...

Designer as a creator, artist, all about starting from scratch:
inspiration, citation, some words to about references, kind of forking 
designer inspired by another but a bit stress about the fact his design is new and different not a copy and infringe the authour's right. The limit of derivation in the classic copyrigth in design.

> Some months ago I received a Cease and Desist (C&D) letter from the agent of Inter IKEA Systems B.V., citing that my site IKEAhackers.net has infringed upon its intellectual property rights. [...]
> Long story short, after much negotiation between their agent and my lawyer, I am allowed to keep the domain name IKEAhackers.net only on the condition that it is non-commercial, meaning no advertising whatsoever.
> I agreed to that demand. Because the name IKEAhackers is very dear to me and I am soooo reluctant to give it up. I love this site’s community and what we have accomplished in the last 8 years. Secondly, I don’t have deep enough pockets to fight a mammoth company in court."

A "mental model" of design
---------------------------------------
Good design is mostly viewed as a luxury product and is reserved for an elite. Even 

"Recuperation by collector/Art market" (I dont't if it's the right thing for that)
Original social design initiatives in the past like furnitures of Gerrit Rietveld, Enzo Mari, Jean Prouvé, some product of Bauhaus, become now masterpiece because of the "rarity" of these objects. A Jean Prouvé's school desk is about 3000€ on the art market

**Designed localy, fabricated far away**
branding about great design by famous designers, fabrication on the other planet side to limit cost for end user but mainly to keep an interessant and comfortable margin for the producer

**Mass production**

**Design for rich people**
Design associated to luxury

Back to the source, taking care of human, what open source can offer to you.

Learn more about tradition, existing design, not to rethink always the wheel, don't focus your design about revenue but more about service. 

We are looking for a generous creative attitude where we know that an artwork is diverted by nature. Inspiration is everywhere. Allow copy is promote creativity, accelerate design process, not to rethink always the wheel...

Choosing opensource way/idea you can rely on a community for help, for co-working, to remix, aware with the copying, just think that a real copy does'nt really exist, because of the materials or the tools you use to remake an object might be not exactly the same.

Patent don't give you a pefrect protection against compagny doing "aggressive" copies (see example above). What can you do if you don't have enough "big shoulder" to fight against this (lawyer to pay...) So assume copy, is a way to abstract this constraint.



You can be more close to your final users and get a objective feedback on your design.
Final user can also help you by providing positive returned experiences, because you allow him/her to improve the object. 

End User:
you can change the role of the final user
/// Oui, le consommateur n'est plus juste un utilisateur passif et peut devenir lui même créateur, producteur, réparateur. Il a tous les outils pour le devenir. Les licences libres invitent à la curiosité, à l'apprentissage et au partage des connaissances. Encore faut-il que l'acheteur aie conscience du caractère « libre » de ce qu'il achète.
Le consommateur peut s'approprier un objet, en faire un usage différent ou l'adapter à ses propres besoins. Cet acquis généralement admis pour tout ce qu'on achète n'est plus aussi vrai aujourd'hui.////

You can keep control on your design regarding copyright, because with the copyleft attitude, the exclusive appropriation is not possible. For example, if you design a chair with an opensource license, Ikea can be interested to produce and sell your design, but only with the same conditions as defined by the license. That means, you or another compagny can also sell or distribute your design. A totally different way of the traditional exclusive distributing design. Compagny might be not interested by selling product also distributing by a competitor.

Your design can be more spread around the world and give the opportunity to use or adapt it for people in developing countries for example. This is about democratisation.

You are speciliazed in custom made design, so why not sharing your design ?
It can be reused, remixed in another place/country, in another context...You can democratized your work in that way. Why not ask for fees if people abroad need some help to adapt the design?

I don't know if it's interesting or in the right place, maybe more in the economical part, but choosing opensource can be an alternative to this or another way to spread design 

Classic Design Editors > it is about royalties revenues (3 to 5%)
When you are young designer you might be interested to work for an editor, it is not easy.
You need experiences, it take time, you need connections, network, visit fairs around the world...time, energy, money and the chance to work with is low.

Context 

Pourquoi avoir décidé de donner une dimension "libre" à votre travail et qu'entendez-vous, selon vos pratiques et votre approche, par justement cette licence libre mise sur les objets ? Que permet-elle ? En quoi cela modifie-t-il le design et la conception d'objets, de meubles, etc ?

Publier un objet sous licence libre est une forme d'alternative à la protection traditionnelle des objets de type dépôt de modèle, de brevet. Étant donné leur caractère limitatif (durée, territoires) et leur coûts relativement importants, opter pour une licence libre permet de garantir le respect et la protection du droit d'auteur, tout en assurant sa visibilité et sa diffusion. Le dépôt de brevet n’empêche pas la copie, les grands groupes dépensent des fortunes en procès pour lutter contre. Assumer la copie permet de se libérer de cette contrainte. Une copie chinoise n'est de toute façon pas la même chose qu'une copie officielle en terme de valeur émotionnelle.
L'utilisation de licences libres change aussi le mode de production, de conception et de fabrication d'un objet. Le travail de designer demande énormément de qualités et de savoir-faire. Un seul objet peut prendre des années à se concevoir et requiert de multiples compétences. Souvent, plusieurs personnes interviennent dans le design d'un seul objet. Le fait de publier sous licence libre ouvre la possibilité de travailler à plusieurs, à distance et de manière ouverte par des jeux de cycles publication-modification successifs.
L'idée est également de faire vivre en d'autres lieux, des projets souvent dessinés pour des contextes particuliers et pour une durée plus ou moins limitée et de permettre ainsi à d'autres d'utiliser et de s'approprier ces designs.
La question de la copie est dans le milieu du design souvent un tabou, une crainte. L’attitude que nous recherchons se veut créative généreuse ou l’on reconnaît que toute œuvre est par nature dérivée.
L'inspiration est partout. Permettre la copie c'est favoriser la création, accélérer le processus de conception, cela permet de ne pas ré-inventer la roue à chaque nouveau projet. C'est aussi un choix politique, un positionnement éthique.
Aussi le collectif Libre Objet nous permet d’expérimenter plus, en nous affranchissant de certainescontraintes de commande, de créer des outils et des plate-formes de publication de ces objets, d’organiser des ateliers et de participer à des événements liés au design.

Qu'est-ce que ça change pour la personne qui achète l'objet, ou le construit lui-même dans sa relation avec les objets (dépasse-t-on l'opposition classique consommateur/producteur) ?

Oui, le consommateur n'est plus juste un utilisateur passif et peut devenir lui même créateur, producteur, réparateur. Il a tous les outils pour le devenir. Les licences libres invitent à la curiosité, à l'apprentissage et au partage des connaissances. Encore faut-il que l'acheteur aie conscience du caractère « libre » de ce qu'il achète.
Le consommateur peut s'approprier un objet, en faire un usage différent ou l'adapter à ses propres besoins. Cet acquis généralement admis pour tout ce qu'on achète n'est plus aussi vrai aujourd'hui.
Souvent l'acheteur « perd sa garantie » s'il manipule l'objet qu'il a acheté ou en fait une utilisation inappropriée. Au pire, il risque même des poursuites judiciaires dans certains cas. Avec les objets libres, nous revendiquons le plein pouvoir de l'acheteur sur ce qu'il a acquis. Et même plus. Les objets produits en grandes séries répondent-ils exactement aux attentes de chacun, de manière universelle? Ou se situe ma liberté d'action ?
Si un acheteur / modificateur souhaite partager son adaptation et en faire bénéficier à la communauté, grâce aux licences libres, la redistribution est autorisée, même pour une utilisation commerciale.
Combien d'objets achetez vous aujourd'hui que vous pouvez modifier et revendre ?
Cette approche des objets par les licences, n'est pas uniquement dans un but pratique, mais permet aussi à l'acheteur de prendre conscience des implications « sociales » de son geste et de pouvoir agir dessus.

**Why did you chose open design? 
> because is ecodesign?**
Ecodesign is an approach to designing product with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its  whole lifecycle. In a life cycle assessment, the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecodesign
When designer is preocupated by opensource, he is surly an humanist person. So environmental aspect is an important part of his work.
- Procurement: most of the open design project's use local material
- Manufacture: The product is construct on demande localy, you don't have to transport it fom China to Europe for exemple.
When a person chose an openproduct, she is not a lambda customer.
She's more in a collaborative consumption and in a sharing economy than is less 
polluting system than productive consumption.

### Shaker movement
The shaker movement is a religious sect that had guiding principles of simplicity, utility and honesty. Their beliefs were reflected in the well-made furniture of minimalist designs.
The Shakers' dedication to hard work and perfection has resulted in a unique range of architecture, furniture and handicraft styles. They designed their furniture with care, believing that making something well was in itself, "an act of prayer." Before the late 19th century, they rarely fashioned items with elaborate details or extra decoration, but only made things for their intended uses. [...]
Early 19th-century Shaker interiors are characterized by an austerity and simplicity. The simple architecture of their homes, meeting houses, and barns have had a lasting influence on American architecture and design.

### Victor Papanek
He was a designer and educator who became a strong advocate of the socially and ecologically responsible design of products, tools, and community infrastructures. He disapproved of manufactured products that were unsafe, showy, maladapted, or essentially useless. His products, writings, and lectures were collectively considered an example and spur by many designers. Papanek was a philosopher of design and as such he was an untiring, eloquent promoter of design aims and approaches that would be sensitive to social and ecological considerations. He wrote that "design has become the most powerful tool with which man shapes his tools and environments (and, by extension, society and himself).

### Jean Prouvé
Jean grew up surrounded by the ideals and energy of "l'École de Nancy," the art collective to which his father belonged. Its goals were to make art readily accessible, to forge links between art and industry, as well as between art and social consciousness.

The metal furniture of Jean Prouvé was produced copiously in every studio and workshop. His work involved frequent collaboration, most famously with Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret.[16] The style is set apart from the Bauhaus steel furniture of the time by his rejection of the steel tube technique. Prouvé had more faith in the durability and form of sheet metal, "bent, pressed, compressed than welded". His designs speak of a work philosophy that includes knowledge of the materials at hand, a commitment to collaboration between artists and craftsmen, an attention to evolving technical developments, and "the principle of never postponing decisions so as neither to lose the impetus nor indulge in unrealistic forecasts". Prouvé was influential in the development of the idea of nomadic architecture, likening a chair to a house, and designing both with portability in mind.

### Art and design
[Carpenters Workshop Gallery](http://carpentersworkshopgallery.com)
"When we started out, less than a decade ago, there was little  connection between art and design. Since then, things have changed so  much. We are pleased to see that now there are designers who no longer  do industrial design; they are creating a new kind of discipline that is  closer to art", - says Julien Lombrail about the concept of the  gallery.
It's the art market create that kind of design. The price of the pieces are very huge, just an elite can buy it. And the "Designer" now called "artist" became stars.

### Enzo Mari
Enzo Mari is a noted Italian modernist artist and furniture designer.
He is famous for his *Autoprogettazione* manual. 

*The 19 ‘Do-It-Yourself’ furniture designs, which the Italian Designer Enzo Mari published in his book ‘Autoprogettazione’ in 1974, marks a milestone in the comtemporary design history. Positioned in contrast to the formalism at the time, Enzo Mari suggests the democratisation of design and creating a provoking alternative to the capitalist paradigm of mass consumption. Building your own furniture, when required, that’s the idea.* Also that project born in 1974 just after the first oil crisis in 1973. The poverty in Italy and all Europe was huge, Enzo Mari by this project, show that problem and give an social design answer.

### Gerrit Rietveld
Rietveld was a Dutch furniture designer and architect. One of the principal members of the dutch artistic movement called *De Stijl*.Piet Mondrian is the most famous figure from that movememt. Rietveld is famous for his Red and Blue Chair and for the Rietveld Schröder House.

About Crate series:
The original “Krat” (Crate) furniture was produced using untreated red spruce normally reserved for packing cases. It was sold in a kit form, to be assembled at home by the purchaser. The Crate furniture was a response to the economic crisis of the 1930s. It offered useful, inexpensive seating with basic construction and cheap materials. Other items of 'Crate' furniture include a Crate easy chair, Crate table, Crate desk, Crate bookcase and a Crate stool, all from 1934.

### Thomas Chippendale
Thomas Chippendale was a London cabinet-maker and furniture designer in the mid-Georgian, English Rococo, and Neoclassical styles. In 1754, he published a book of his designs titled *The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director*.
