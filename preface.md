Introduction
========

The term "open source" is becoming a trend among product designers. We see websites and initiatives appear here and there with a lot of good intentions but sometimes missing the point and often creating confusion. Design magazines and blogs are always rushing into calling an openly published creation "open source" but rarely talk about the license or propose schematics or design files to download. 

During the past 3 years of existence of the collective Libre Objet (link is external)  and the many workshops we organized, we have constantly heard these  questions and spend a lot of time trying to explain these somehow  difficult concepts, if you don't have a long experience with libre  sotfware. There is a lot of info to digest and not really a  comprehensive documentation so far that could help someone get in the  train of libre product design. With the time available during  Interactivos and the diversity of people joining for these two weeks, we  plan to make together the "manual to get started making and publishing  libre and open source objets".   
 
We hope that this tool could be a base for teaching and learning about  open source product design, a collective memory of what one should know  today to get started and join the movement, a reference students,  amateurs and professionals would have in their back pocket when they go  out to explain what they are passionate about.   

How to read this book
-------------------------------

We have divided this book in sections that made sense for us. Each of these try to adress what we think is a general question you would have or you should have about open source product design. These sections are independent from each other and can be read individually, but they also interconnect and interfere with each other, as you will see. So you could just start reading from wherever you feel you're most interested in and find your way through the book or just follow the steps as we've laid them for you.

For each section, we've tried to keep a similar structure that is divided as following:

- First we've put the theoretical part, where we define, explain and develop the concepts.
- Then we give you a list of **tools** that are related to that section. As designers, we are not only producing objects, we are also building an intimate relation with the tools we are using. 
- After this comes a series of open source **objects** that we think best represent what the chapter is about
- And we finish with **open questions**, for us and for you, to think further about your practice.
